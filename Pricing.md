# Pricing

## Platform pricing
To use the Cloudomation platform, you always need an active subscription package associated with your account. There are four subscription packages available: trial, starter, standard and premium. Each subscription package contains a support services package, as well as Cloudomation Tokens. Please refer to the [Tokens](/documentation/Tokens) site to understand what Cloudomation Tokens are.  

When you first create an account on the Cloudomation platform, you are automatically issues with the Trial subscription package. This package is for free, and allows you to explore and test the Cloudomation platform for up to six weeks.  

We want you to be convinced by our product, and not be shackled by contract conditions. All subscription packages can be cancelled with the end of each month.

## Service pricing
Cloudomation software support services are included in the subscription packages as described above. In addition to the support services, we are happy to support you on your automation journey with professional services. Please refer to the [services](/Services) page for more information about our professional services.

All our professional services are provided on as time-and-material projects. This means that we agree beforehand what we would like to achieve, we provide you with an estimate of how much time we expect to spend to achieve the agreed goals. Each project is estimated individually. Final invoicing is based on the actual time spent working on your project, as well as any additional items such as travel or infrastructure and licensing cost - as agreed in the project proposal. We do not offer fixed price projects, nor do we offer team enhancement engagements.

Baseline price for professional services for an automation expert provided by us is â‚¬150 / hour during normal CET working hours (Mo-Thu 9-5, Fri 9-1), with services delivered remotely.

In addition to providing services ourselves, we are happy to connect you with members of our partner network.
