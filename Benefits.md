# Benefits

What are your benefits from using Cloudomation?  
Cloudomation is based on one core idea: **incremental gains**.

Incremental gains means that you realise value step by step. It is a concept that is ideally suited to automation, and it leads to a set of guiding principles that inform our product development and our business philosophy:
- Stepwise value gains
- Complement (and not replace)
- Simple changes
- Minimum maintenance  
- Broad applicability

### Stepwise value gains

With Cloudomation, it is feasible to automate very small tasks. In fact, we recommend starting small. A business that wants to go the full nine yards to achieve automation excellence in all areas of their business, as well as a business that is looking to automate just one single process - both need to start by breaking down the automation journey into individual steps. And with Cloudomation, you can realise your automation step by step.

Cloudomation integrates with almost any environment and software process, which means that you can automate one part, plug it into the exising system, and see how that feels. Cloudomation is agentless, which means that you don't need to make any changes to existing environments to start automating. You can just start. Make your own small automation your first proof of concept - and you will realise quickly that you save time, gain on reliability and efficiency, from the very first automated task onwards.  

If you do not have the resources to continuously commit to large automation projects, this workflow will suit you. Whenever you do have the resources, take another step - automate the next item on your list, and advance on your automation journey. The more tasks you have automated, the more time you will free up to focus on the next step.

And when you have other priorities in the business, you can continue to benefit from the automations you have already realised.  

This approach is based on the realisations that led to the creation of agile software development: you never know all the requirements at the start, the requirements that you do know about will change, and there will always be more to do than you have time to do. These are facts that are true for an automation project as much as for any other software or DevOps or IT project. And Cloudomation is uniquely suited to help you cope with the uncertainties of IT projects: by enabling you to go from a working automation to a slighly better working automation, step by step.  

This also supports the best practice of modular development: each automation should realise a well-defined task. Keeping things modular makes your automations easier to maintain, easier to modify, and easier to reuse.  

Cloudomation supports this approach with its pricing structure as well: you can start very small, and add to your subscription as you extend your automations. There is no need for large, up-front investments, or large rip-and-replace projects to change your entire infrastructure. You business will continue to run as it is - and you will add automations step by step.

### Complement

Cloudomation is able to integrate with almost any software solution and therefore supports you in *increasing the efficiency of existing systems* through automation. There is no need to replace existing systems. And if you do want to replace an existing system with Cloudomation, then you can do so step by step - moving one piece of functionality over to Cloudomation after the other.

Cloudomation provides functionality that is specific to the task of *software automation*, but agnostic to the type of software that is being automated. As such, Cloudomation is not a test automation suite, nor is it a marketing automation tool, or an automated billing system. Cloudomation is the component that sits between all these specialised solutions and enables you to integrate them into larger, cross-platform, cross-departmental workflows.

There are many very good automation solutions on the market that focus on specific use cases - such as software testing. It is not the purpose of Cloudomation to replace these tools, and it is arguably more complicated to set up a software testing process with Cloudomation than it would be to set up a software testing process with a specialised software testing solution. What Cloudomation is particularly good at is the integration of many solutions into larger workflows. Staying with the example of software testing, Cloudomation can integrate software testing into a complete continuous integration pipeline. This pipeline can incorporate your version control system, your build system, your test system, your deployment system, your update scheduler, and more components.

### Simple changes

All functionality provided by the Cloudomation platform uses the same, simple, well-defined input-output structure. This makes it very easy to modify existing automations. Requirements change, your IT landscape changes, and Cloudomation supports you in keeping up with these changes by making it easy for you to adapt automations to changing environments.

Using the same input-output structure for all Cloudomation functions means that you don't need to change much to replace one function with a different one. You can reuse defined parameters, inputs, and outputs for additional or modified components easily. It also means that you can use new functionality quickly - you don't have to learn a new input-output structure.

In addition, we recommend modular design of automation workflows which makes it even easier to make specific changes to existing workflows without having to redevelop, replace, or redo anything. You can always continue to build on your existing automations.

### Minimum maintenance

To realise efficiency gains through automation early in the process, maintenance of automations needs to be effortless. Cloudomation realises this through its extremely robust design. It is transaction safe, self-healing, and deployed redundantly to ensure failover safety. Once you have defined your automations, they will run - come rain or come shine. The self-healing nature of Cloudomation means that maintenance efforts by your team will be minimal.

In addition, Cloudomation provides automation-as-a-service - as a user of the platform, you have zero maintenance effort related to the automation software itself.

### Broad applicability
<img src="/sitedata/images/broad_applicability.jpg" alt="broad applicability" class="responsive d-none d-md-block" style="float:right; margin: 10px 20px"/>
Enabling you to profit from automation incrementally means that Cloudomation has to be able to support you across different functions in your business. You can start automating where you need it most - and then move on to the next process in need of improvement, and so on. If you start automating in your IT department, and then have a surge in orders that you need to deal with more efficiently - go ahead and automate your delivery process, your web shop, or any other process that is at the front of your mind. Go back to add the next step in your IT automation when you have solved your other problems.

In addition to helping you to continuously increase the value you get from your automations, the broad applicability of Cloudomation means that you can tie together processes across environments, tools, and systems that were previously unthinkable. Step by step, your automations will become more complex. Once you have reached a point where you have integrated processes that were previously not possible, and are now not only possible but easy, you will reach automation bliss - the point where you know that you can manage anything, step by step.
