# About Us

Cloudomation is the product of Starflows company. At Starflows, we believe in the power of automation to improve lives. We want to free you from the burdens of repetitive, boring tasks. We want to help you sleep at night because you know that all is well and your servers are humming happily. We want to help you achieve operational excellence.

We believe that the best way to create a truly excellent product is by working closely with our users, and by building a solution that we ourselves love to use. And we do - we use Cloudomation excessively in our own operations and are proud to have achieved a level of operational excellence none of the Starflows team have experienced previously in their professional careers. Which frees us up to focus on what we are best at: building a truly great product.

Our goal is to help you reach that same point, where all the mundane tasks, the maintenance, the updates, testing, build, deployment, everything that you do more than once - no longer needs to be on your mind. Automate anything with Cloudomation, and make time for yourself for the fun tasks, the innovation, and the things that bring your business forward, instead of just maintaining where you are.

If you have an idea how we could do our job better, please let us know: send us a message at [info@cloudomation.io](mailto:info@cloudomation.io). We value your feedback.

## Team
Starflows was founded by Stefan and Margot MÃ¼ckstein, siblings with a shared passion for software and automation.

Stefan earned his spurs during his dozen-year tenure at a leading provider of software automation solutions. Inspired by their mission, Stefan set out to bring the benefits of automation to a wider audience. At Starflows, Stefan serves as Chief Technology Officer, Lead Developer, and Chief Happiness Officer. Because that is what it is all about for us: happiness - which is much easier when you know that your IT infrastructure is up and running, even if you're off playing with your kids or taking a quick snooze.

Margot is a Psychologist, Data Scientist, Project Manager, Event Organiser, Software Consultant, recreational writer and improving as a developer. Her job as Chief Executive Officer of Starflows is to build a business around Stefan's amazing work.
