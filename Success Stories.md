## Cloud build: Google Cloud Build versus Cloudomation
A small software startup used Google Cloud Build to deploy the infrastructure for their cloud based software platform. Google Cloud Build is an amazing tool and had saved them a lot of time already. However when they moved to Cloudomation, they were able to:
- Reduce the size of the script by almost half: the Google Cloud Build yaml file had 693 lines, while the Cloudomation flow script had only 380. This improved readability and made maintenance and changes much easier.
- Besides being half the size, the Cloudomation flow script could do more than the Google Cloud Build yaml. In addition to the previous features,
  - updates were rolled out in a fixed order, enabling proper management of dependencies
  - only processes where a change was detected were updated, instead of always rolling out a full build, leading to much faster builds
  - integration tests were automatically triggered after deployment

And this was just the start - now, they can continue to build out their continuous integration pipeline with Cloudmation and add more and more pieces to their automated workflow.
