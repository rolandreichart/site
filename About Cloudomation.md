# About Cloudomation

Imagine you could play Lego with software. How much fun software integration would be!

Picture every piece of software that you have in your organisation as a building block. Making your software work together means using your blocks to build something bigger: it is possible, but with regular building blocks it quickly becomes precarious. If one block falls over, your entire tower comes down.  
With Cloudomation, your building blocks become Lego pieces: you can fit them together seamlessly, in almost any structure you want. You can start by fitting to pieces together, and continue to build it out. It can become very big and complex, while remaining robust. You can reuse the individual pieces, and it is as easy to extend as it is to build.

Cloudomation is a cloud platform for software automation. It empowers system administrators, DevOps engineers, developers, and others to deal with increasingly complex IT infrastructures. Integrate diverse and siloed IT landscapes, manage your infrastructure in one place, and reliably offload repetitive tasks with Cloudomation.

Cloudomation can work across departments, tools, and technologies to automate virtually any IT process. With Cloudomation, managing your IT becomes easier, faster, and more reliable.

## What Cloudomation does
Cloudomation is focused on providing automation-specific functionality. This means that we are not specialised on a specific industry, a specific use case, or a specific set of tools. Instead, we want to empower you to master the entire breadth of your IT operations with the Cloudomation platform.

The following graphic gives a non-exhaustive overview of Cloudomation functionality.

## What makes Cloudomation special

### Automation-as-a-service
As a cloud platform, Cloudomation provides automation as a service. As as Cloudomation user, you can focus fully on your automations and leave the bother of maintaining the automation software to us. Our cloud platform offers options for highly secure communication between your environment and the Cloudomation platform. There is also an option to deploy Cloudomation on-premise or on a cloud of your choice to comply with even higher security requirements.

### Transaction safety
Automations implemented on Cloudomation are transaction safe. This means that, no matter what, your automations will run.  
It is in the nature of software that errors happen - a server is busy and refuses connections, a workstation loses power and shuts down, your backup solution runs out of storage space: these things happen. With Cloudomation, issues like these do not affect your automations. It is possible to simply freeze an automation at the current point of execution and resume at a later time, e.g. triggered by a change in a target system.  
This allows you to build robust, self-healing automations that are extremely reliable.

### Scalability
Cloudomation is highly scalable, achieved through a micro-services architecture that allows resource-efficient scaling. This means that you can run your automation one time, ten times, or ten thousand times in parallel - performance will be the same. The intelligent architecture of Cloudomation supports seamless scaling and elasticity, meaning that it automatically scales up when needed, and scales down again when not needed, in real time. It also scales only those components which it needs more of, thus using resources very efficiently and achiving extreme scalability at moderate cost.

### Agentlessness
Cloudomation is agentless. You can run your automations on any remote system with no need to pre-install any components. Through this, you are very flexible in your automations and can work with almost any remote environment.

### General purpose
Cloudomation is a general purpose tool. You can use it for automations in any industry, for any use case. Use it for continuous integration, data processing, or automating your billing or time keeping systems - anything is possible.  

### Python
In Cloudomation, you write your automations in Python. This means that you have all the power of Python available to you in your automations to complement Cloudomation's core functionality, making the use of Cloudomation comfortable and easy even for less experienced programmers.  
In addition, Python is one of the most popular programming languages of our time and becoming more and more popular. As such, Python is one of the most commonly known languages in the IT world. You will have no trouble finding people with the right skills to set up and maintain your automations.
