<i class="fa fa-lock fa-5x fa-pull-left"></i> Protecting your personal data is important to us. Therefore, we collect and store only the minimum amount of data about you that is required for us to provide you with the best possible service. Our data collection and storage policies fulfil at minimum the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Austrian data protection law. In this privacy statement, we want to inform you about which personal data we collect, store, process, and to which end we do so.  

## 1 Personal data
The GDPR applies to the storage and processing of personal data. Personal data is all data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data encompasses your name, address, email address, sex, date of birth etc. The word “data” in this policy refers to your personal data.

## 2 Responsible

Phone: +43 677 619 577 09  

When we say “we” or “us” in this policy, we refer to Stefan Mückstein.

## 3 Third party processors
We do not share your data with third parties without your express permission unless as required to fulfil our contract with you. Those third party processors whom we contract to provide services necessary to fulfil our contract are bound by the same stringent data protection laws of the European Union as we are. We are in control of the data these third party processors collect, store, and process. No analysis of your behaviour or preferences (profiling) is conducted by third party processors. We do not sell your data to third parties.  

## 4 Contacting us
If you choose to contact us via the email addresses provided on this site, we will store the data provided by you to process your request - i.e. to respond to your email, and follow up on any further communication with you. We will not pass on any of your personal data to third parties without your express consent.

## 5 Cookies and web analytics
Cookies are files with small amounts of data that are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer’s hard drive.

The Cloudomation website does not use Cookies. No web analytics tools are used to track your behavior on our website. We do not collect or store any information about you as you browse our website.

For the Cloudomation platform, you have the option to set a login Cookie. When you log into the Cloudomation platform, there is a checkbox “remember me”. If you select this checkbox, a login Cookie will be created and stored in your browser. This login token contains your login information and will log you in automatically whenever you use the same browser on the same device to access the Cloudomation platform. The login Cookie is valid for 90 days by default. You can delete the login Cookie from your browser at any time. No information other than your login information is stored in the Cookie and it is not used for any other purpose than logging you in.

## 6 Newsletter
If you choose to sign up for our newsletter, we will store the name you give and your email address for the duration of your subscription.

Once you sign up, you will receive a welcome email. The welcome email, as well as all future newsletter emails, contain a link to unsubscribe from the newsletter. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter by sending an email telling us that you wish to unsubscribe to [info@cloudomation.io](mailto:info@cloudomation.io). Please understand that we can only accept your cancellation if you send it from the same email address with which you have subscribed to the newsletter.

Once you unsubscribe from the newsletter, we will delete your name and email address from our newsletter mailing list.

You subscription to the newsletter is fully independent of any platforum subscriptions or other communication you may have with us. We do not connect your newsletter subscription to your platform account information or any of your data.

This means that you can sign up and unsubscribe from the newsletter independently of your platform subscription, using any email address and name of your choice.

It also means that cancelling a platform subscription and requesting deletion of your data does not include deletion of your newsletter subscription or deletion of your name and email address from the newsletter mailing list. If you wish to delete your name and email address from our newsletter mailing list, you can do so by unsubscribing from the newsletter.

## 7 Community support groups
We encourage the use of public community groups such as stackoverflow and superuser, and are active in these communities as well. However as these forums are not operated by us, we are not responsible for data collection, storage, and processing on these sites. Please refer to the privacy statements of these forum sites for information about how they handle your personal data.

## 8 Flow script library
We encourage the sharing of flow scripts in our public flow script library. If you choose to share a flow script with the community, you can choose if you want to claim authorship of your flow scripts or if you want to publish them anonymously. If you choose to claim authorship, your name and any other information you would like to include will be published together with your flow script.

## 9 Service Desk
If you purchase a Cloudomation subscription package that includes access to the service desk, you will have the opportunity to create an account on our online service desk. Your account on the service desk requires a name and email address, and may store other personal data if you choose to provide it (e.g. through support requests). We will store and process your name, email address, as well as other data provided by you through the service desk for the duration of your active subscription to the support package that includes the service desk account, for the purpose of providing software support services to you.

Note that you are not required to create an account on our service desk if you do not wish to do so, even if your subscription package would include a service desk account. If you wish to not use or to delete an existing service desk account, please let us know with a short email to [info@cloudomation.io](mailto:info@cloudomation.io).

In the case that you no longer use the service desk - due to cancellation or downgrade of your account or any other reason - we will remove your name and email address from the service desk system. The service desk tickets you create will remain undeleted but will no longer be associated with your person. You can request deletion of individual tickets at any time.
