We had a great time with all of you who joined us for our **product launch party** on March 1st - thank you for your enthusiasm and your participation!

Check out the [pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tqm3oom1o1v8ZVQW9) from the event. We also created some materials in German for the launch party: a short [explanation of Cloudomation](/sitedata/downloads/Cloudomation_kurz_erklärt.pdf), a few [examples](/sitedata/downloads/Cloudomation_Beispiele.pdf), and [definitions](/sitedata/downloads/Cloudomation_was_bedeutet.pdf) for some of the jargon we use when describing Cloudomation.

We hope you had as good a time as we had!

Cloudomation version 1 will be publicly available in February 2019. Join us in celebrating this milestone on **Friday, March 1st 2019** at **18:30** at the **ZI8 co-working space**. We will talk a little bit about Cloudomation, answer questions, and show you where we currently are - and we will celebrate with sparkling wine, snacks and drinks.

We are proud about taking this big step, and are looking forward to the many next steps that will follow: we’re only getting started!

Please note that the event will be held in German language due to the mostly German-speaking audience.
