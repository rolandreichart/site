<img src="/sitedata/images/party_horn.PNG" alt="celebration" class="d-none d-md-block" width="100" style="float:left; margin: 10px 20px"/>
Cloudomation version 1 will be publicly available in February 2019. Join us in celebrating this milestone on **Friday, March 1st 2019** at **18:30** at the **ZI8 co-working space**. We will talk a little bit about Cloudomation, answer questions, and show you where we currently are - and we will celebrate with sparkling wine, snacks and drinks.

We are proud about taking this big step, and are looking forward to the many next steps that will follow: we’re only getting started!

Please note that the event will be held in German language due to the mostly German-speaking audience.
