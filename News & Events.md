We had a great time with all of you who joined us for our **product launch party** on March 1st - thank you for your enthusiasm and your participation!

Check out the [pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tqm3oom1o1v8ZVQW9){ext} from the event. We also created some materials in German for the launch party: a short [explanation of Cloudomation](/sitedata/downloads/Cloudomation_kurz_erklärt.pdf), a few [examples](/sitedata/downloads/Cloudomation_Beispiele.pdf), and [definitions](/sitedata/downloads/Cloudomation_was_bedeutet.pdf) for some of the jargon we use when describing Cloudomation.

We started the launch party with an analogy: the tower of Babel failed because people lost the ability to communicate with each other. Unable to coordinate their efforts, the tower of Babel was never completed.

We see the same thing happening in modern IT infrastructure: lots of individual components that do their thing, but they are not connected. Without coordination, without exchanging information, the IT infrastructure often fails to achieve its goals.  

This is where Cloudomation shines: Cloudomation can integrate and connect all your software components. Cloudomation translates, coordinates, and aligns.  

Define a good process once, and then let Cloudomation take care of executing it: coordinating all the software components that are needed, making sure they have all the information they need, know what to do, and when. Build your own tower of Babel that reaches the sky: a fully integrated IT landscape that achieves all its operating targets.

Sounds good?

Cloudomation version 1 will be publicly available in February 2019. Join us in celebrating this milestone on **Friday, March 1st 2019** at **18:30** at the **ZI8 co-working space**. We will talk a little bit about Cloudomation, answer questions, and show you where we currently are - and we will celebrate with sparkling wine, snacks and drinks.

We are proud about taking this big step, and are looking forward to the many next steps that will follow: we’re only getting started!

Please note that the event will be held in German language due to the mostly German-speaking audience.
