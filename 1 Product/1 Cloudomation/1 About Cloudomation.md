# About Cloudomation

Businesses of every size struggle with increasingly complex IT systems: the landscape of available software solutions is growing exponentially and many companies are challenged with very diverse, siloed and often outdated IT infrastructure. As a consequence, cost efficiency and reliability in IT operations is more important than ever before, and will become more and more relevant as the scope of tasks handled by computers increases further.

Cloudomation offers a solution to the problem of increasing complexity in IT operations. It is a general purpose software automation tool that allows companies to automate virtually any IT process. It can work across departments, tools, and technologies. Cloudomation empowers IT teams to handle complexity and integrate diverse software landscapes. With Cloudmation, management of IT infrastructure becomes easier, faster, more reliable, and enables businesses to confront the IT challenges of the future successfully.

## Core features
As a cloud platform, Cloudomation provides **automation as a service**. As as Cloudomation user, you can focus fully on your automations and leave the bother of maintaining the automation software to us. Our cloud platform offers options for highly secure communication between your environment and the Cloudomation platform. There is also an option to deploy Cloudomation on-premise or on a cloud of your choice to comply with even higher security requirements.

Automations implemented on Cloudomation are **transaction safe**. This means that, no matter what, your automations will run.  
It is in the nature of software that errors happen - a server is busy and refuses connections, a workstation loses power and shuts down, your backup solution runs out of storage space - these things happen. With Cloudomation, issues like this do not affect your automations. It is possible to simply freeze an automation at the current point of execution and resume at a later time, e.g. triggered by a change in a target system.  
This makes automations run with Cloudomation **extremely reliable**.

Cloudomation is **highly scalable**, achieved through a micro-services architecture that allows resource-efficient scaling. This means that you can run your automation one time, ten times, or ten thousand times in parallel - performance will be the same. The intelligent architecture of Cloudomation supports seamless scaling and elasticity, meaning that it automatically scales up when needed, and scales down again when not needed, in real time. It also scales only those components which it needs more of, thus using resources very efficiently and achiving extreme scalability at moderate cost.

Cloudomation is **agentless**. You can run your automations on any remote system with no need to pre-install any components. Through this, you are very flexible in your automations and can work with almost any remote environment.

Cloudomation is a **general purpose** tool. You can use it for automations in any industry, for any use case. Use it for continuous integration, data processing, or automating your billing or time keeping systems - anything is possible.  

In Cloudomation, you write your automations in **Python**. This means that you have all the power of Python available to you in your automations to complement Cloudomation's core functionality, making the use of Cloudomation comfortable and easy even for not very experienced programmers.  
In addition, Python is one of the most popular programming languages of our time and becoming more and more popular. As such, Python is one of the most commonly known languages in the IT world. You will have no trouble finding people with the right skills to set up and maintain your automations.
