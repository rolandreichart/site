# Services

Cloudomation offers [professional services](#professionalservices) as well as [software support](#softwaresupportservices). Please refer to the [pricing](Pricing) section for information about service pricing.

## Professional Services
Professional services with Cloudomation can only be purchased in combination with token subscriptions to the Cloudomation platform. Services can be agreed for a range of topics centered around the use of Cloudomation. The main service categories on offer are implementation services and training.  
Implementation services are focused on the defintion of automation workflows - first implementations, or also extensions and optimisations of existing automation workflows. Training focuses on the transferral of knowledge and skill around the use of Cloudomation to define automation workflows.

All professional services delivered by Cloudomation are project based and are intended as short engagements. A standard setup of a professional services project will be based on the following principles:
* Agile delivery mode
* All projects include a project management role from Cloudomation
* Flow scripts developed are made available to the community in an anonymised version, if and where possible
* Capacity building and knowledge transfer is part of every project, best achieved through mixed teams with members from Cloudomation and your organisation

Agile delivery mode refers to a project delivery methodlogody characterised through iterative improvements on the project outcome (the product), which is delivered in sprints. Each sprint ends with a working version of the product. One of the three parameters of time, resources, and scope has to be flexible, with a preference for flexible scope.

Professional services can be purchase directly from Cloudomation on a time-and-material basis. Cloudomation does not offer fixed price engagements. As an alternative, Cloudomation can refer you within the Cloudomation partner network for professional services delivery through one of our partners.

## Software support services
Software support can be purchased only as part of a token & support package. For pricing and package details, refer to the [pricing](Pricing) section.

The main service delivery channel of Cloudomation is the Cloudomation service desk. Through the service desk, you can ask questions, report issues, suggest new features, and provide general feedback on the Cloudomation platform.
